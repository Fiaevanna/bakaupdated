    <p class="about__header">Hello and welcome to Clothes for "BAKA"</p>

    <p class="about__bread-text">
      This is my webshop, where the focus is on both appearance and
      functionality. The name "BAKA" is inspired by the Japanese word meaning
      "fool."
    </p>

    <p class="about__bread-text">
      About two years ago, I started this project with the goal of learning the
      basics of HTML and CSS through a school assignment. Over the course of a
      month, I had the freedom to create something entirely my own, and the
      result was a design I was very satisfied with. Now, two years later, I
      felt it was time to improve and further develop the project to achieve an
      even better final result.
    </p>

    <p class="about__bread-text">
      I decided to modernize and restructure the entire website by rewriting the
      code in Astro. The goal was to refresh the design, enhance performance,
      and make the code flow more readable. Although the webshop is relatively
      simple, I wanted to place great emphasis on details and craftsmanship.
      During the update, I chose to implement a database to manage all product
      content more efficiently. Given the project's size, I found that SQLite
      was the perfect choice for high performance with a smaller data set. To
      handle database communication, I opted for Drizzle.

    <p class="about__header" >SCSS and Styling</p>
    <p class="about__bread-text">
      When it came to styling, I upgraded my CSS to SCSS to structure my
      elements more efficiently. However, during the process, I realized that
      the code became difficult to read and cluttered. After some research, I
      decided to use BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) as a method to create
      reusable components and maintain a cleaner code structure. This approach
      resulted in a clearer and more streamlined design.
